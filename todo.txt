1 "called" property doesn't work (add statistics or fix it) - works now
2 add an easier way of printing data when passing through a transform - from the config file? Done. and added JMX as well.
3 why does http get open 2 connections? bosch! Done.
4 create a hex dump like printout utility. Done.
5 add message tracing - uniquely identify the message and follow it through the transforms? might not work through transformations easily
6 add property debug stack tracing to setValue code - problem is there is no log4j in property library currently. Done.
7 add a way of printing out all transform properties (help.properties). Done.
8 add a readme.txt file. Done.
9 add a transform version number to complement the framework version number?
10 add a "*" option for the Counter range to mean all. Done.
11 make a project file for doing plugin development?
12 make it a library?
13 package documentation. Done.
14 XA SMF protocol parsing. Done.
15 Add odd and even to Counter transform. Done.
16 Finish aggregator transform, and have it use 1 buffer on output.
17 If right hand side of a link statement is not defined there is no error. Done.
18 Explain benefits of using a tunnel over having an sdk do manipulations. tcp backpressure, closing of connections, late/delayed/duplicate messages
19 add full smf parsing so that toString() prints something useful.
20 show the config file name and location in JMX. Done
21 add nth count to Counter transform. Done.
22 Why does loglevel property set in one transform apply to all. Incorrectly scoped and initialised. Done.
23 Add exiting from Impulse from JMX. Done.
24 Add having a range [low-high] for the delay transform. Done.
25 Fix Impulse.format() to format a Map<String, Object> object.
26.Fix httpFramer to use a server instead of a tunnel. 
27 Printer transform does not work.
28 printer.properties uses a Server transform instead of a Tunnel (maybe ok). 
29 Add the client ip address to the server, tunnel, wsserver attribute list. Done.
30 Check transform debug logs for format. Basically turn on debugging of everything and check the output.
31 Document how to turn on debugging for everything.
32 For the socket server have a property that mirrors whether accepting is on/off and removed the actions. Done.
33 Add a feature/transform that blocks? for a specified time. For example, a login is dropped for 3 minutes to let resources time out.
34 Change from the .properties extension to .imp? And document that they have a properties format.
35 Wildcard -Dtransform.tunnel.serverIPPort=192.168.160.186:55555 -Dtransform.tunnel1.serverIPPort=192.168.160.186:55555 
   -Dtransform.tunnel2.serverIPPort=192.168.160.186:55555 so that it is one system property. Done.
36 Look into possibility of inlining this into client code.
37 In the sample config files put all the properties even if they are set to default.
38 After framing, the input buffer from the tunnel needs rewinding or need to use a copy.
39 Printing of ByteBuffers needs to take into account the index position rather than printing out the backing array.
40 Command line -D doesn't work. Try with wildcards as well. Done.
41 Rename JMXDelayer to just Delayer?
42 Make sure framers can handle more than one message per buffer.
43 Fix up continuation messages for WebSockets.
44 Add a transform for breaking WebSockets data messages into continuations? or does the sending client take care of that.
45 Break the Tunnel/Server up into SocketInbound and SocketOutbound. Done.
46 For HTTPFramer, allow specializing on text msgs, binary msgs, close msg, etc...
47 For HTTPFramer sample, the close conection WS message should be propagated through the tunnel
48 Make a sample that's WS from the client to the tunnel and smf to the router (or whatever the payload is). Put this in core.
49 Make the listen port in ServerSocket a list/range. Done.
50 Add handling of TL1 termination characters in quotes and comments.
51 Add handling of TL1 continuation characters.
52 Add additional parsing of TL1 starting with TID and CTAG.
53 Add the use of javascript in the transform to do custom handling.
54 Add a transform that drops TL1 responses from an NE.
55 Add the ability to send a TL1 message from a file (maybe this is accomplished with javascript).
